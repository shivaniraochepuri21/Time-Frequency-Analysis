Project Title: Estimation of Instantaneous Pitch Frequency in Speech Signals <br>

Objectives: <br>
To Study and Explore the Algorithm proposed in the Main paper and cited papers for instantaneous pitch estimation. <br>
To explore and implement VMD and VMD based optimisation algorithm in matlab.<br>
To achieve proper input parameters for VMD.<br>
To plot and compare results with other methods for pitch estimation.<br>
Strike some comparisons (VMD vs EMD).<br>
